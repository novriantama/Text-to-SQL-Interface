# **Text-to-SQL Interface with Guardrails and Hallucination Detection**

**What You’re Building:** A natural language interface that translates plain English questions into SQL queries against a real database, executes them safely with guardrails preventing destructive operations, validates that the generated SQL actually answers the question asked, and presents results with a confidence score.

| Why This Project Lands Interviews Text-to-SQL is one of the highest-value applications of LLMs in enterprise settings, and it’s notoriously hard to get right. Building one with guardrails and hallucination detection proves you can ship AI features that a compliance team would actually approve — which is the bar for production AI at any serious company. |

**Step-by-Step Build Guide**

## **Phase 1: Build the Schema-Aware Prompt Engine (Day 1–3)**

**1\.  Auto-extract the database schema:** Use SQLAlchemy to introspect the database and produce a structured representation: tables, columns with types, primary/foreign key relationships, and sample values for categorical columns. This becomes the context the LLM uses to write SQL.  
**2\.  Build the dynamic prompt constructor:** For each user question, assemble a prompt with: the relevant schema (not the entire database — filter to tables likely needed), foreign key relationships, sample values for disambiguation, and any column descriptions or business glossary terms. Include 3–5 few-shot examples of question-to-SQL pairs specific to this schema.  
**3\.  Implement schema filtering:** For large databases, sending the entire schema wastes context and confuses the model. Build a lightweight relevance filter: embed the user question, embed table/column descriptions, and include only tables above a similarity threshold. This keeps the prompt focused and improves generation accuracy.  
**4\.  Handle ambiguity explicitly:** When the user’s question maps to multiple possible interpretations (e.g., “revenue” could mean gross or net), return a structured clarification request instead of guessing. List the interpretations with example queries for each. This is a production feature most demos skip.

## **Phase 2: Build the SQL Generation and Safety Layer (Day 3–6)**

**1\.  Generate SQL with structured output:** Use the instructor library or function calling to ensure the LLM returns: the SQL query, a natural language explanation of what it does, a confidence score, and a list of tables and columns accessed. Validate the SQL syntax before execution using sqlparse.  
**2\.  Implement the guardrail middleware:** Before any query executes, pass it through a safety layer that: blocks all DDL (CREATE, ALTER, DROP), blocks all DML writes (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE), enforces a row limit (LIMIT 1000 if none specified), rejects queries with subqueries deeper than 3 levels, and blocks queries estimated to scan more than N rows using EXPLAIN. Make each rule configurable and log every blocked query with the reason.  
**3\.  Add query sandboxing:** Execute all generated queries in a read-only transaction that rolls back automatically. Use a database user with SELECT-only permissions as a second layer of defense. Even if the guardrail layer misses something, the database permissions prevent damage.  
**4\.  Build the execution layer:** Run the validated SQL, capture results as a DataFrame, and package the response with: raw results (capped at the row limit), execution time, rows returned, and the EXPLAIN plan. Log everything for auditability.

## **Phase 3: Build the Hallucination Detection System (Day 6–9)**

**1\.  Implement SQL-to-question verification:** After generating the SQL, send the query back to the LLM with the prompt: “What question does this SQL query answer?” Compare the back-translated question to the original. If they diverge significantly, the SQL probably doesn’t answer the right question. Score the alignment and flag low-confidence translations.  
**2\.  Add result sanity checking:** After execution, perform basic sanity checks: are aggregated values within plausible ranges? Do counts match expected magnitudes? Are date ranges within the data’s timespan? Are there NULL-heavy columns that might indicate a bad JOIN? Flag anomalies with specific explanations.  
**3\.  Build the multi-query validation:** For complex questions, generate two different SQL approaches independently (e.g., using different JOIN strategies or aggregation methods). Execute both. If results match, confidence is high. If they diverge, flag the discrepancy and present both results with explanations. Agreement between independent approaches is a strong correctness signal.  
**4\.  Create a confidence scoring system:** Combine signals into a single confidence score: SQL syntax validity, back-translation alignment, result sanity check pass rate, multi-query agreement, and schema coverage (did the query use the tables/columns you’d expect for this question type?). Display confidence prominently alongside every result.

## **Phase 4: Build the Query Interface (Day 9–11)**

**1\.  Build the API endpoints:** POST /v1/query accepts a natural language question and returns: the generated SQL, execution results, confidence score, and any guardrail warnings. GET /v1/schema returns the database schema. GET /v1/history returns past queries and results for the session.  
**2\.  Create a Streamlit or React frontend:** A clean interface with: a text input for natural language questions, the generated SQL displayed with syntax highlighting (editable for power users), results in a sortable data table, the confidence score with a breakdown of contributing signals, and a history panel showing past queries.  
**3\.  Add a feedback loop:** Let users mark results as correct or incorrect. Store this feedback alongside the query. Incorrect results become new test cases for the eval suite. Correct results become new few-shot examples that improve future generation. This is the flywheel.

## **Phase 5: Build the Evaluation Suite (Day 11–13)**

**1\.  Create a golden query dataset:** Write 50+ natural language questions with verified correct SQL and expected results. Include: simple lookups, multi-table JOINs, aggregations with GROUP BY, date range filters, questions with ambiguous phrasing, and questions the database cannot answer. This is your regression suite.  
**2\.  Run automated evals:** For each test case, measure: SQL exact match (does the generated SQL match the golden query?), execution match (do results match regardless of SQL approach?), hallucination detection rate (does the system correctly flag bad queries?), and guardrail effectiveness (are dangerous queries blocked?).  
**3\.  Containerize and document:** Docker-compose with: PostgreSQL seeded with sample data, the FastAPI service, and the frontend. Include a README that leads with the eval numbers: “X% execution accuracy, Y% hallucination detection rate, zero unsafe queries executed across Z test cases.”

## **Phase 6: Polish for Portfolio (Day 13–14)**

**1\.  Record the demo:** Show: a natural language question being translated to SQL, the guardrail blocking a dangerous query, the hallucination detector catching a bad translation, and the multi-query validation resolving a discrepancy. Under 4 minutes.  
**2\.  Write the narrative:** Frame it as: “I built a text-to-SQL system with a X% accuracy rate that blocks 100% of destructive operations and detects Y% of hallucinated queries before they reach the user.” Lead with safety. Companies care more about not breaking things than about accuracy percentages.
